# Sandook LLC site (v2)

Minimal, mobile-first site with section-based layout and subtle animations.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Upload these files to your repo root (replace old ones).
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (main / root).
3. If using a custom domain, set it in Pages and keep the DNS on GoDaddy pointing to GitHub Pages.
4. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after the cert is ready.

## Customize
- `index.html` — edit copy, email, links
- `styles.css` — colors/spacing
- `assets/logo.svg` — replace if you have a brand mark
